              <FAQItem
                question="What is the difference between a developmental delay and a developmental disability?"
                answer="A developmental delay means a child is lagging behind peers in one or more areas (like speech, motor skills, or learning). It can sometimes be temporary. A developmental disability is a chronic condition due to a physical or mental impairment that typically lasts throughout a person's lifetime and significantly impacts daily functioning (e.g., Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down syndrome). Early intervention is key for both, but the long-term prognosis and support needs often differ."
              />
              <FAQItem
                question="How can I best talk to my child about their neurodevelopmental diagnosis?"
                answer="Use clear, simple, and age-appropriate language. Focus on their strengths alongside challenges, explaining that their brain works differently, not 'less than.' Reassure them of your love and unwavering support. Frame the diagnosis as a way to understand themselves better and access helpful tools. Many organizations (like those listed above) offer guides on this topic tailored to specific conditions."
              />
              <FAQItem
                question="What are effective strategies for managing meltdowns or challenging behaviors?"
                answer="Key strategies include: 1. Identifying triggers and functions of the behavior (what happens before and what the child gains). 2. Maintaining predictable routines and environments. 3. Using visual supports. 4. Teaching coping skills and emotional regulation. 5. Consistently applying positive reinforcement for desired behaviors and planned ignoring (when appropriate) for minor challenging behaviors. Consulting a behavior specialist or psychologist can provide personalized strategies."
              />
              <FAQItem
                question="How can I effectively advocate for my child's educational needs at school?"
                answer="Understand your child's rights under laws like IDEA (for IEPs) or Section 504. Keep detailed records of communications, evaluations, and progress. Build a collaborative relationship with the school team. Be clear about your child's needs and provide documentation. Prepare for meetings by writing down your points and desired outcomes. Don't hesitate to ask questions or seek support from parent advocacy groups or educational advocates."
              />
              <FAQItem
                question="Where can I find reliable local support groups or qualified professionals?"
                answer="Start with your child's pediatrician or specialist for recommendations. National organizations listed on this page often have directories of local chapters or providers. Your local school district's special education department can be a resource. Websites like Psychology Today also have searchable databases of therapists. For support groups, search online for local parent groups related to your child's specific needs."
